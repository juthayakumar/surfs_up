Three differences between the weather for both months include:
* the average temperature was about 4 degrees more in June
* The max temperature was higher in June
* It was colder in December for mminimum temperature, colder by 8 degrees.

## Summary 
After observing statistics for both months, I would say that the shop can be opened all year round. The data was not strongly skewed between the two months, as the max temperatures were fairly close, and the min temperatures weren't too far off either. Average temperatures were only 4 degrees different. 

A few other queries I would perform to gather more weather data for June and December would be precipitation and wind conditions for each month. Nonetheless, based off of the data for temperatures, I would keep the shop open.
